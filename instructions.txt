[INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE CODE – BUILD IYANBARRY.COM]

You are an expert full-stack developer inside Claude Code.

Your job: **build a complete, production-ready personal website for iyanbarry.com** based on the specs in this file.

I will run your changes in a fresh repo, so please:
- Create all necessary files and folders.
- Use clear, modern, and minimal design.
- Add real copy from the details below (not lorem ipsum).
- Assume I’ll deploy this on a typical modern host (e.g. Vercel/Netlify).

--------------------------------------------------
1. TECH STACK & GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------

Use this stack:

- Framework: **Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript**
- Styling: **Tailwind CSS**
- Content: 
  - **Markdown/MDX** files for blog posts in a `/content/blog` directory
  - A simple **TypeScript config file** or JSON for projects/links
- Icons: `lucide-react`
- Fonts: use default system fonts (no complex font setup)
- Theme: clean, minimal, friendly. Light mode by default, simple dark mode toggle if easy to add.

General requirements:

1. Fully responsive (mobile-first, then tablet, then desktop).
2. Good basic SEO:
   - Title, description, open graph tags.
   - Page titles should be meaningful (e.g. “About – Iyan Barry”).
3. Clear navigation:
   - Top navbar with: **Home, About, Projects, Blog, Contact**.
4. Simple color palette:
   - Light background, dark text, accent color for buttons/links.
5. No backend required beyond what Next.js needs.
6. Use functional components and modern React patterns.

--------------------------------------------------

Create an `/about` page with:

- A primary intro section with:
  - Headline: “About Iyan”
  - 3–5 paragraph narrative bio, using the following key points:
    - Based in Brisbane, Australia.
    - General Manager – Information Technology (CIO-equivalent).

  - Bullet-style or short paragraphs:
    - Continuing to uplift IT maturity and cybersecurity.
    - Experimenting with AI-powered workflows and bots.
    - Writing about leadership, AI, and experimentation on the blog.

--------------------------------
3.3 PROJECTS PAGE
--------------------------------

Create `/projects` that reads from a simple TypeScript data file, e.g. `data/projects.ts`.

Each project should have:
- `title`
- `slug`
- `description`
- `tags` (string array)
- Optional: `link` (if external) or `status` (“Active”, “In progress”, “Experiment”)

Seed it with 5–7 example projects, using copy like (rewrite in your own words but keep meaning):

1. **Safe Places IT Transformation**
   - Description: Multi-year program leading the IT function from reactive support to a proactive, strategic capability. Included redesigning structure, implementing Freshservice, uplifting cybersecurity, and aligning to ISO 27001.
   - Tags: `["IT leadership", "Cybersecurity", "Governance"]`

2. **Internal AI Assistant (Safe Places)**
   - Description: Early work on an internal AI assistant for staff using open-source LLMs and company knowledge, focused on secure, private use cases.
   - Tags: `["AI", "Internal tools", "Productivity"]`

3. **KindlyScan / KindQR (QR-based donation concept)**

   - Tags: `["Product design", "Fintech", "Social impact"]`

4. **Forex Trading Bots & AI Research**
   - Description: Ongoing experiments building algorithmic trading systems and AI-assisted trading logic, including backtesting, automation, and risk management ideas.
   - Tags: `["Trading", "AI", "Experiments"]`

5. **ThinkTryGrow**

   - Tags: `["Content", "Automation", "Learning"]`

6. **3D Printing Experiments (Bris3D)**
   - Description: Exploring small-scale consumer 3D printing services and prototypes, focusing on simple gadgets and promotional pieces.
   - Tags: `["3D printing", "Prototype", "Side project"]`

Projects page requirements:
- List view of cards (grid on desktop, stacked on mobile).
- Filter by tag (simple client-side filter or buttons at the top).
- Clicking a project can either:
  - Go to an external link (if provided), OR
  - Open a simple `/projects/[slug]` page (optional). If you create detail pages, seed them with basic content.

--------------------------------
3.4 BLOG PAGES
--------------------------------

Blog structure:

- Store blog posts in `/content/blog` as **Markdown** (or MDX) with frontmatter fields:
  - `title`
  - `date`
  - `summary`
  - `tags` (array, e.g. ["Leadership", "AI"])
  - `published` (boolean)

Create a simple blog engine that:
- Reads all posts at build time.
- Lists them on `/blog` sorted by date (newest first).
- Supports filtering by tag (optional but nice).
- Each post has its own page at `/blog/[slug]`, generated from filename.

Create 3–4 **example posts** with short but real content (not lorem ipsum). Example topics (rewrite nicely):

1. `leading-it-teams-in-the-real-world.md`
   - Tags: `["Leadership", "IT"]`
   - Summary: Reflect on taking an IT team from “reactive and overwhelmed” to structured and proactive.
   - Include ideas like:
     - Getting clear on priorities.
     - Building trust with the business.
     - Small wins and fast feedback loops.

2. `using-ai-as-an-it-leader.md`
   - Tags: `["AI", "Leadership"]`
   - Summary: How I see AI as an enabler, not a magic solution, and how I’m using it to remove friction for myself and my team.
   - Include mention of:
     - Using tools like ChatGPT/Claude for drafting docs, exploring ideas.
     - Automating small tasks to free up time for meaningful work.
     - The mindset of experimentation (try, learn, adjust).

3. `side-projects-as-a-leadership-lab.md`
   - Tags: `["Side projects", "Leadership", "Experiments"]`
   - Summary: Why small experiments (apps, bots, tools) are a good sandbox for learning that feeds back into the day job.

4. `why-i-started-iyanbarry-dot-com.md`
   - Tags: `["Personal", "Meta"]`
   - Summary: Short story of why the site exists: a central place to share work, ideas, and experiments.

Keep the writing style:
- Clear, conversational, practical.
- First person (“I”).
- No over-the-top self-promotion.

--------------------------------
3.5 CONTACT PAGE
--------------------------------

Create `/contact` with:

- Short intro paragraph: “If you’d like to connect about IT leadership, AI, or just compare notes on side projects, reach out.”
- Options:
  - Mailto link: `iyanbarry@gmail.com`
  - Button or link to LinkedIn profile: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/iyanbarry/`
- A simple contact form is optional, but if you add it, just make it a front-end only form for now (no backend wiring required, maybe just a placeholder “This form is not wired up yet.” message).

--------------------------------------------------
4. LAYOUT, COMPONENTS & DESIGN
--------------------------------------------------

Create reusable components, at minimum:

- `components/Layout.tsx`
  - Wraps all pages with header, main, footer.
- `components/Header.tsx`
  - Site logo (just text “Iyan Barry”).
  - Navigation links.
  - Optional theme toggle (light/dark).
- `components/Footer.tsx`
  - Simple footer with © year and small note.
- `components/ProjectCard.tsx`
- `components/PostCard.tsx`
- `components/TagBadge.tsx` (for tags on projects/posts, optional but nice)

Design guidelines:
- Use generous white space.
- Clear typography hierarchy:
  - Larger font for hero headline.
  - Reasonable line length for reading blog posts.
- Links and buttons should look like they belong together stylistically.

--------------------------------------------------
5. SEO & METADATA
--------------------------------------------------

Set up a basic metadata system:

- Default site title: `“Iyan Barry – IT Leader & Builder”`
- Default description: something like:
  - “Personal site of Iyan Barry, an IT leader based in Brisbane, Australia. Sharing work, experiments, and thoughts on leadership, cybersecurity, AI, and building things.”
- For blog posts:
  - Title from post frontmatter.
  - Description from `summary`.

Include a simple `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` if straightforward to add.

--------------------------------------------------
6. IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST FOR YOU (CLAUDE)
--------------------------------------------------

1. Initialize a Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind project structure (no need to show `npm` commands, just create files as if the repo already exists).
2. Set up Tailwind config and global styles.
3. Implement layout, header, footer, and navigation components.
4. Implement each page:
   - `app/page.tsx` (Home)
   - `app/about/page.tsx`
   - `app/projects/page.tsx`
   - `app/blog/page.tsx`
   - `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`
   - `app/contact/page.tsx`
5. Create `data/projects.ts` with the initial project list.
6. Create `/content/blog` folder and add the example Markdown posts with frontmatter.
7. Add helper utilities to:
   - Read blog posts from the filesystem.
   - Parse frontmatter.
8. Wire up the blog listing and individual post pages.
9. Make sure the project builds conceptually (no obvious TypeScript or import errors).
10. Avoid placeholder “TODO” where you can reasonably add actual content.

--------------------------------------------------
7. OUTPUT FORMAT
--------------------------------------------------

In your reply in Claude Code, please:

- Provide the full file and folder structure (tree).
- Provide the full contents of each new/modified file in clearly marked code blocks.
- Do not include explanatory prose between every line of code; keep explanations short and focused.
- Assume I will copy these files into a repo and run `npm install` / `npm run dev` myself.

End of instructions.
