For years, I've been building things—internal tools, trading bots, process improvements, team transformations. Most of it lived in scattered notes, private repositories, or conversations that ended when the meeting did.

I realized I was missing opportunities to reflect on what I was learning and share it with others who might benefit from the same insights.

## The Catalyst

The tipping point came during a conversation with another IT leader who was facing similar challenges: reactive teams, security debt, resistance to change. As I shared approaches that had worked for us, I thought: "How many other people could benefit from these learnings?"

That's when I decided to build this site.

## What This Isn't

This isn't a corporate blog optimized for thought leadership points. You won't find buzzword-heavy posts about "digital transformation" or "synergistic solutions."

This also isn't a technical tutorial site. There are better places to learn specific technologies or frameworks.

## What This Is

This is a collection of real experiences, honest reflections, and practical experiments from someone who's been in the trenches of IT leadership and building things.

I write about:
- Leading technology teams through real challenges
- Using AI tools in practical, non-hype ways
- Building side projects that teach unexpected lessons
- The messy reality of cybersecurity and governance work

## The Format

Most posts will be short and focused. I'm not trying to write comprehensive guides—just capture insights while they're fresh and share approaches that might be useful to others.

I'm also documenting my side projects here. Not because they're groundbreaking, but because the process of building them often teaches more than the final product.

## The Audience

I'm writing primarily for other people in technology leadership roles, especially those working in smaller organizations where you wear multiple hats and have to figure things out as you go.

But if you're a developer, project manager, or anyone interested in the intersection of technology and leadership, you might find something useful here too.

## The Commitment

I'm planning to publish 2-3 posts per week. Nothing revolutionary—just consistent sharing of what I'm learning and building.

Some posts will be about work. Some will be about side projects. All will be honest about what worked, what didn't, and what I learned in the process.

Thanks for reading. If you're working on similar challenges or experiments, I'd love to hear about them.
