AI isn't magic. It's a tool—a powerful one—but still just a tool. The key is understanding where it actually helps and where it doesn't.

After months of experimenting with ChatGPT, Claude, and various AI-powered tools in our IT operations, here's what I've learned about using AI as a leader.

## AI as a Thinking Partner

My biggest win with AI isn't automation—it's using it as a thinking partner. When I'm stuck on a complex problem or need to explore different approaches, I'll dump my thoughts into Claude and ask it to help me think through the angles I might be missing.

It's like having a really good consultant available 24/7, one that never gets tired of brainstorming and doesn't charge by the hour.

## Removing Friction from Routine Tasks

The real value comes from removing friction from tasks that drain mental energy:

- Drafting policy documents and getting past the blank page
- Reviewing and improving email communications before sending
- Breaking down complex projects into actionable steps
- Generating different options for solving recurring problems

These aren't the sexy use cases, but they're the ones that give me back 5-10 hours per week to focus on strategic thinking.

## Building AI Literacy in the Team

I've started encouraging my team to experiment with AI tools for their own work. Not mandating it—just making space for experimentation and sharing what works.

The results have been interesting. Our junior developers are using GitHub Copilot to learn faster. Our senior engineers are using AI to explore new technologies before diving deep. Our project managers are using it to draft better communications.

## The Mindset of Experimentation

The biggest shift has been adopting an experimental mindset. Try something small, see if it works, iterate. AI tools evolve fast, so what didn't work six months ago might be perfect now.

For example, we're piloting an internal AI assistant for common IT questions. It's not replacing our helpdesk, but it's deflecting simple queries and helping staff find answers faster.

## What Doesn't Work (Yet)

AI isn't good at:
- Understanding complex organizational context
- Making nuanced decisions about people and priorities
- Replacing deep technical expertise in specialized areas
- Handling sensitive situations that require empathy

These remain firmly in the human domain, and trying to automate them backfires.

## The Real Opportunity

The opportunity isn't to replace human judgment—it's to augment it. AI handles the routine cognitive load, freeing us to focus on the uniquely human aspects of leadership: building relationships, making complex decisions, and creating environments where people thrive.

That's where the real value lies.
