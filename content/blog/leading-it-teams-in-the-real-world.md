When I stepped into the General Manager – IT role, I inherited a team that was drowning. Every day was firefighting. Tickets piled up faster than we could close them. Strategic projects gathered dust while we scrambled to keep the lights on.

Sound familiar? It's the story of countless IT teams in growing organizations.

## Getting Clear on What Actually Matters

The first breakthrough wasn't technical—it was clarity. We spent weeks just getting honest about what we were really trying to achieve. Not the glossy mission statements, but the real work: What does success look like for the people we support? What would make their jobs easier?

We discovered that half our "urgent" work wasn't urgent at all. It was just loud. The real priorities were buried under noise.

## Building Trust Through Small Wins

Trust doesn't come from grand promises. It comes from consistently doing what you say you'll do, especially when those things seem small.

We started with simple wins: fixing that printer that had been broken for months, finally getting that software license sorted, responding to emails within 24 hours. Boring stuff that actually mattered to people.

Each small success bought us credibility to tackle bigger challenges.

## The Power of Fast Feedback Loops

One of our biggest shifts was moving from quarterly planning cycles to weekly check-ins. We'd test ideas quickly, get feedback, and adjust. Not everything worked, but we learned faster.

This approach transformed how we handled everything from security improvements to software rollouts. Instead of six-month projects that missed the mark, we delivered value incrementally.

## Structure Enables Creativity, Not Kills It

There's a myth that processes stifle innovation. In reality, good structure creates space for creativity by handling the routine stuff efficiently.

We implemented basic ITIL practices, not because we love frameworks, but because they freed our team to focus on solving interesting problems instead of reinventing incident response every time something broke.

The result? A team that went from reactive to proactive, from overwhelmed to strategic. We're still not perfect, but we're building something sustainable.

The lesson: transformation isn't about dramatic gestures. It's about consistent, thoughtful changes that compound over time.
